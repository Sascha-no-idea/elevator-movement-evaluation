# Measurement and evaluation of the velocity and pressure during an elevator ride

The following investigations were conducted as project for technical mechanics III class at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences ([BHT](https://www.bht-berlin.de/)) of [Department VIII](https://www.bht-berlin.de/viii). The goal is to evaluate the movement of an elevator during a full travel cycle. Jerk and pressure values were recorded using the [phyphox](https://phyphox.org/) mobile phone app and numerically integrated in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) to calculate acceleration, velocity and position of the elevator at any time.
